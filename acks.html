Here is some feedback we have for your plot and accompanying text:<br><br>
Overall the plot looks pretty good. I like your idea of using past data and data from the current unfinished season to predict what could have happened if it were to have played out.<br></br>
Here are some things you could do to improve your plot:
<ul>
	<li>Label the x and y axis (and don't forget units when necessary)</li>
	<li>Get rid of the numbers (0,5,10,15...) on the x-axis because those are not needed</li>
	<li>Add a title, make sure to specify what year the data is from too</li>
	<li>Turn the team name at the top of each bar sideways or horizontal so they don't overlap, and make the name bigger so it's easier to read</li>
	<li>OR move the team names to be underneath the bars underneath the x-axis</li>
</ul>
Here are some things you could add to improve your accompanying text:
<ul>
	<li>Explain what win percentage is and how you found that statistic</li>
	<li>How you will use past data to extrapolate future data?</li>
	<li>Are there other statistics that might help explain why certain teams have a higher win percentage than others? What other patterns in the data can you find?</li>
</ul>
